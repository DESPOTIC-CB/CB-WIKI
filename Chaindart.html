  <h1>Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar Guide (Latest Patch)</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Playstyle Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar is a lightning-fast assassin class built for hunting down enemy heroes with hit-and-run tactics. Wielding a chained dart and curved blade, this hero excels at mobility, burst damage, and disrupting enemy backlines. An all-purpose build for this class emphasizes hero pressure (picking off enemy players), high mobility (to engage and escape at will), and constant harassment (poking and distracting foes). In battle, you’ll dart in to incapacitate key targets, unleash deadly combos to burst them down, then vanish before the enemy can retaliate. However, with only light armor, this class is fragile – success hinges on timing, positioning, and knowing when to disengage. Used wisely, the Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar can dominate duels and sow chaos among enemy ranks, even if it contributes less against massed troops.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Playstyle Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Extreme Mobility:</strong> Multiple movement skills (leaps, lunges, and a hookshot ultimate) let you engage or escape on demand, making you hard to pin down. You can literally jump into enemy formations and back out in seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Assassin Hero Killer:</strong> One of the best hero-killing classes in Conqueror’s Blade – you specialize in quickly eliminating or pressuring enemy heroes who stray too far or get isolated. Your combo burst can delete squishier heroes before they can react.</li>
      <li><strong>Hit-and-Run Tactics:</strong> Thrives on opportunistic engagements – wait for the right moment when a target is vulnerable, then strike hard and fast. After securing a kill or if the situation gets dangerous, use your escape tools immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>High Skill Ceiling:</strong> This class rewards timing and map awareness. You must pick fights carefully; a mistimed dive into a group can mean instant death due to your fragility. Mastery of combo execution and stamina management sets great Chain Dart players apart.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Anti-Unit Impact:</strong> Crowd-clearing is not your forte. Your damage output and CC are mostly single-target. Fighting large groups of units head-on is a weakness – you lack sustained AoE damage or durability for extended brawls.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Skills and Traits</h2>
    <p>
      The Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar’s kit centers around closing gaps quickly, locking down a target, and executing a burst combo before darting away. Key skills include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Trap Prey (Ultimate):</strong> Your signature hookshot ability – throw your chained dart to hook a target (hero or unit) and pull yourself to them. This instantly closes distance and can even yank mounted targets or be used while on horseback for a “drive-by” attack. Trap Prey momentarily controls the victim (a brief stun/hold), setting them up for your combo. <em>Trait:</em> Enables engagements from range; with a rune, it <strong>Concusses</strong> (stuns) the enemy for 2 seconds on hit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scorpion’s Snare:</strong> A lunging gap-closer and combo starter. You leap forward and grab the first enemy hit, flip behind them, and slash with your scimitar. This deals high damage and applies Winded (stamina regen debuff). <em>Trait:</em> Puts you behind the target (ideal for back attacks) and briefly disorients them, also reducing the target’s slashing defense by 5% (or up to 30% with upgrades) for a short time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leap and Slash:</strong> A jumping overhead strike with the scimitar. You leap up and slam down on the target, dealing heavy slashing damage. <em>Trait:</em> Serves as both a mobility tool (small jump) and a burst damage skill. With specialization, it briefly stuns the enemy on hit (0.5 seconds), helping chain your combo.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stinging Strike:</strong> A fan of thrown darts that you hurl in front of you, costing stamina instead of having a cooldown. It’s essentially a spammable ranged attack – useful for harassing or finishing off fleeing enemies. <em>Trait:</em> Though modest in damage, it’s great for softening targets or interrupting actions from a safe distance. Each hit can reduce the cooldown of Scorpion’s Snare by 1 second, making your combo available more often. In the latest patch, using Stinging Strike with the full class armor set also refreshes your other key skills’ cooldowns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sandstorm (Smoke Bomb):</strong> Your escape tool – drop a smoke bomb at your feet, damaging and slowing nearby enemies by 30%, and vault backwards approximately 13 meters. It breaks pursuit and creates distance. <em>Trait:</em> It also cleanses crowd control by removing Dazed, Knockdown, or Concussed status effects from you.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excellent Mobility:</strong> Few classes can reposition as rapidly. You can engage or disengage almost at will, allowing you to exploit enemy mistakes and cover ground quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>High Burst Damage:</strong> Your combo of hook, stab, and slash delivers explosive burst damage, capable of killing or severely wounding enemy heroes before they can react.</li>
      <li><strong>Hero Slayer / Duelist:</strong> In 1v1 situations or small skirmishes, Chain Dart shines. You excel at isolating a single target and locking them down with crowd control (stuns, concuss, slows) long enough to secure a kill.</li>
      <li><strong>Harassment &amp; Zoning:</strong> Thanks to Stinging Strike and your sheer threat presence, you can harass enemies from mid-range and disrupt their actions, effectively denying them positions or objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Hit-and-Run Survival:</strong> When played smartly, you’re hard to catch and can slip away after delivering your burst.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fragile (Glass Cannon):</strong> You wear light armor and have low innate toughness – any direct confrontation or focus fire can kill you quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooldown &amp; Stamina Reliant:</strong> Your effectiveness comes in bursts. After you expend your combo (Ultimate, Snare, Leap, etc.), you have a window of vulnerability while waiting on cooldowns. Resource management is critical.</li>
      <li><strong>Requires Timing and Positioning:</strong> As an assassin, you must carefully pick your moments to strike, avoiding traps and ambushes.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Team Support:</strong> You don’t provide much in the way of buffs, heals, or unit leadership; your contribution is mainly eliminating enemy heroes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Skill Rotation (Engage, Burst, Escape)</h2>
    <p>
      To maximize your burst, execute a combo rotation that locks down your target and deals damage in a quick sequence. A common engage → burst → escape sequence is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Engage – Trap Prey:</strong> Target a vulnerable enemy hero (ideally high-value or isolated) and use Trap Prey (ultimate) to hook them and pull yourself in.</li>
      <li><strong>Burst – Scorpion’s Snare:</strong> Once in close range, follow up with Scorpion’s Snare to damage the enemy and flip behind them, applying a slashing defense debuff.</li>
      <li><strong>(Optional) Follow-Up:</strong> If the target survives, use a quick basic attack chain or Stinging Strike to chip away their remaining health. Stinging Strike also reduces the cooldown of Scorpion’s Snare, allowing for another combo opportunity.</li>
      <li><strong>Escape – Sandstorm:</strong> Whether or not you secure the kill, immediately disengage with Sandstorm to avoid counterattacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Alternative engages include using Scorpion’s Snare first if your ultimate is on cooldown or harassing with Stinging Strike to bait an enemy before committing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Gear and Attribute Distribution (Latest Patch)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Armor Set:</strong> Equip the full Sand Scorpion epic armor set (a 4-piece light armor set specific to Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar). The 2-piece bonus reduces your ultimate (Trap Prey) cooldown by 3 seconds, while the 4-piece bonus reduces the cooldown of Leap and Slash and Scorpion’s Snare by up to 4 seconds when you use Stinging Strike.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weapon:</strong> Use the best available Chain Dart &amp; Scimitar weapon (preferably Epic or Legendary). When crafting or reforging, prioritize stats such as Slashing Damage, Piercing Damage, and their related Armor Penetration values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Attribute Distribution:</strong> Allocate roughly 50% of your attribute points to Strength and 50% to Agility. This balanced approach ensures that both your piercing (dart) and slashing (scimitar) attacks are effective while still maintaining a degree of defense.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Pro Tips for Effective Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick Your Targets:</strong> Focus on isolated or high-value enemy heroes such as sharpshooters, bow users, or squishy support classes. Patience is key.</li>
      <li><strong>Combo Discipline:</strong> Commit to a single target and chain your skills for maximum burst damage. Avoid splitting your combo between multiple enemies.</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t Stick Around:</strong> Avoid overextending after a kill. As soon as your target is down (or nearly so), disengage using Sandstorm or sprint away.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Spend time in training or against bots to hone your combo execution, timing, and overall map awareness.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
