  <h1>Dual Blades Guide – Burst &amp; Bleed Harass Build Playstyle Summary</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Playstyle Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Dual Blades heroes in Conqueror’s Blade are nimble assassins, excelling at hit-and-run tactics and single-target burst damage. This Burst &amp; Bleed Harass build emphasizes sneaking behind enemy lines, unleashing high burst damage from invisibility, and applying bleed damage-over-time to weaken foes before slipping away. As a Dual Blades warlord, you rely on invisibility, mobility, and combo chaining to pick off vulnerable targets (especially enemy heroes) while avoiding prolonged fights. You wear only light armor, so timing and positioning are critical – strike when enemies least expect it, then vanish before they can retaliate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Playstyle Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Burst Damage from Stealth:</strong> Dual Blades can deliver explosive burst combos. Attacking from behind or out of invisibility boosts your damage (for instance, the Skylark leap does +30% damage from behind). Opening with your ultimate or a combo chain after stealth often means an enemy hero is dead or near death within seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bleed &amp; Poison Harassment:</strong> Many Dual Blade skills inflict damage-over-time ("bleeds"). Skills like Butterfly cause enemies to bleed for a few seconds, and thrown daggers (Bo-Shurikens) let targets bleed for continual health drain. These effects let you hit-and-run, leaving enemies hurt and pressured to use bandages or retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>High Mobility, Low Durability:</strong> Dual Blades are extremely mobile – with quick dodge rolls, leap attacks, and speed boosts while invisible – allowing rapid repositioning or escape. In return, you are very squishy; a single stun or focus fire can kill you quickly if you’re caught. This build maximizes your strengths (burst and mobility) while mitigating weaknesses by avoiding prolonged fights and using stealth to control engagements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lethal 1v1 Assassin:</strong> Exceptional at hunting down enemy heroes—you have the tools to eliminate vulnerable or high-value targets quickly. Few classes can survive your full combo if caught alone.</li>
      <li><strong>Stealth and Surprise:</strong> With invisibility skills, you dictate when and where to engage. This build capitalizes on flanking and surprise attacks, catching enemies off-guard and tilting fights in your favor.</li>
      <li><strong>Burst + Damage Over Time:</strong> Combines huge burst damage from skills (like Butterfly/Skylark and Marked for Death) with bleed damage-over-time. Even if an enemy survives the initial burst, they’ll often bleed out or be finished off by your harass effects. Bo-Shurikens is your key poke skill.</li>
      <li><strong>High Mobility:</strong> Extremely mobile, allowing quick disengagement after a kill or rapid repositioning to strike another target. Constant invisibility coupled with sprint skills makes you hard to catch.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fragile (Glass Cannon):</strong> As a light armor hero, you have very low tolerance for damage. If caught in the open or stunned at an inopportune moment, you can be killed almost instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Struggles vs. Groups &amp; Frontlines:</strong> Dual Blades are less effective against massed units or tight formations. In the current meta, you can spam Shuriken for AOE bleeding, but fighting groups still presents challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>High Skill Dependency:</strong> Your effectiveness relies on perfect timing and target selection. Mistiming your stealth or engaging the wrong target may leave you exposed with skills on cooldown.</li>
      <li><strong>Countered by Awareness and Choke CCs:</strong> Enemies aware of your approach can stick together or use crowd control skills. Heavy armor heroes with strong healing can negate your bleed advantage. Currently, there is no countermeasure against bleed itself.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Recommended Gear, Runes, and Attribute Distribution</h2>
    <h3>Gear &amp; Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      As a Dual Blades user, you are restricted to light armor only. Generally, you’ll want to gear for maximum offense since this build is about killing quickly before you are hit. Use the highest tier dual blades weapon you can obtain—ideally a purple or legendary dual blades (purple schematic) with high base damage and stats in Strength/Armor Penetration. Look for a weapon that boosts slashing damage and Critical Value, as most of your burst (Skylark, Butterfly, Marked for Death) is slashing-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recommended:</strong> The Epic Set is the way to go for the current meta. Alternatively, a Blue Schematic with bonus stats can work.
    </p>
    <h3>Attribute Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      Aim for high slashing penetration—around 2100 is the threshold—then go full Strength to boost your slashing damage. At this point, you start losing damage versus tankier heroes if you don’t invest accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Skill Rotation</h2>
    <p>
      It’s hard to explain in words how to use the combo on Dual Blades, as there isn’t “the” combo. In the video links below, you can see a dozen different combos and situational variations:

    <h3>Key Skills</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Bo-Shurikens (Dagger Throw):</strong> A ranged dagger toss that allows you to harass safely and briefly re-enter stealth. It deals decent piercing damage and poisons the target (draining ~300 health per second for 3 seconds). Upon throwing, you also become invisible for about 1.2 seconds—ideal for breaking line of sight or repositioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Great Thunderbolt (Concussion Grenade):</strong> A thrown bomb that deals blunt damage in an area and concusses (stuns) any enemy hit. After throwing, you also turn invisible for about 1.2 seconds. At max level, targets hit take 20% more damage for 4 seconds—a great setup for your ult or Skylark.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Combo Chaining:</strong> The essence of Dual Blades lies in chaining skills together. For instance, you might open with Great Thunderbolt to stun and debuff a group, follow immediately with Skylark/Butterfly from behind to deliver burst damage (amplified by the debuff), then use Bo-Shurikens to apply bleed and slow on survivors, and finally, execute Marked for Death on a key hero to finish them off. Many skills grant brief invisibility or bypass blocks, allowing you to weave in and out and bypass enemy defenses.
    </p>

    <h2>TL;DR Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Assassin Playstyle:</strong> Dual Blades is a stealthy assassin class focused on bursting down enemy heroes and then disappearing. This build combines kite, high burst combos, and bleed damage for hit-and-run kills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Skills:</strong> Use Bo-Shurikens for poke and kite, Butterfly for added bleed and slow, and Marked for Death to finish off foes with a flurry of strikes. Alchemical Vapors can serve as a panic button to vanish mid-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Burst + Bleed Combo:</strong> Approach unseen, unleash a devastating combo (with stun or leap in, spin to apply bleed, and an ultimate to execute), and disappear before the enemy can react. Your combo can reduce squishy heroes from 100 to 0, and even tanky targets will eventually succumb from the combined burst and bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strengths:</strong> Exceptionally potent at flanking and eliminating key targets, highly mobile and evasive—you dictate engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Extremely squishy; cannot survive direct confrontations or prolonged crowd control. Relies heavily on cooldowns and timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attributes &amp; Gear:</strong> Invest heavily in Strength (with some Agility) to maximize slashing damage. Equip light armor with offensive stats (critical, damage, penetration) and use runes that boost your stealth attacks and mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tactics:</strong> Play like a “vulture” – pick off weak, isolated enemies rather than engaging head-on. Always have an exit plan and abuse your invisibility to confuse and outplay opponents.
