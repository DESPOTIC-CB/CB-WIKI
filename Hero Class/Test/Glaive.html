  <h1>Glaive All-Rounder Class Guide (Conqueror's Blade)</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Playstyle Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Glaive is a versatile hero class in Conqueror's Blade, characterized by wide-reaching melee attacks and strong defensive capabilities. It plays as a frontline bruiser and support, able to buff allies and control crowds with powerful Glaive swings and crowd-control skills. Glaive users have excellent defenses—with heavy armor and damage reduction skills—and powerful assault/support skills that help assist allies and lock down enemies. This makes the class excel in sustain and teamfight utility, thriving in the thick of battle where it can absorb damage and disrupt multiple foes. However, the Glaive’s mobility is low and it has no ranged attacks, meaning it relies on positioning, timing, and its long reach to dominate fights.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Playstyle Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wide AoE &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Sweeping Glaive attacks can hit multiple enemies, giving the Glaive excellent area control in fights. Skills like <em>Warlord’s Greeting</em> and the ultimate <em>Flying Reaper</em> can stun or throw groups of enemies, turning the tide of large engagements.</li>
      <li><strong>Teamfight Support:</strong> <em>God of Battles</em> uniquely buffs the damage of allies (and yourself) in an area—no other class can directly boost team damage this way.</li>
      <li><strong>Durable &amp; Sustained:</strong> Wielding heavy armor and defensive skills, the Glaive boasts high sustain. It can mitigate damage and shake off crowd control with abilities such as <em>Heat of Battle</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>All-Rounder Utility:</strong> An “all-rounder” build balances offense, defense, and support. It can damage and debuff enemies, buff teammates, control crowds, and sustain itself, making it effective in many situations—whether pushing through a breach or defending a point.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excellent Team Utility:</strong> Provides a unique team damage buff (<em>God of Battles</em>) and strong area crowd control (stuns/knockdowns) that greatly aid allied units and heroes. A Glaive can boost a push or defend an ally by disabling multiple enemies at once.</li>
      <li><strong>Area Damage &amp; Control:</strong> Wide swings and large AoE skills make it effective at clearing groups of units and controlling crowds.</li>
      <li><strong>High Survivability:</strong> With the ability to spec into heavy armor and access significant damage reduction and CC immunity from skills, the Glaive is surprisingly tanky for a DPS class.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible Build Options:</strong> The class can be tailored to different roles—using skills such as Charge for mobility, Breaker of Shields for dueling damage, or Heat of Battle for durability—enabling an all-rounder build that can handle various situations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low Base Mobility:</strong> Very slow to move and reposition without using a skill or mount, making the Glaive susceptible to kiting by ranged or agile enemies. It also struggles to chase down opponents who disengage.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Interrupt Vulnerability:</strong> Some of the strongest attacks (such as <em>Flying Reaper</em> and <em>Hail of Blades</em>) have noticeable wind-ups. A savvy opponent can interrupt these with fast crowd control, leaving you exposed during cooldowns.</li>
      <li><strong>Relies on Team/Units:</strong> The Glaive performs best when supported by allied units. Caught alone by multiple enemies, its lack of escape options and limited burst damage make it an easy target once its defensive cooldowns are used. It isn’t built for solo assassination, requiring teammates or unit backup for optimal impact.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Gear, and Attribute Distribution</h2>
    <h3>Armor &amp; Gear</h3>
    <p>
      As a heavy class, the Glaive should equip Heavy Armor for maximum protection. In particular, the Guardsman’s set (crafted from Rare Armor Schematics) is the standard choice. This set provides high defense and balanced stats that suit the Glaive’s needs. While there is also a class-specific “Royal Sentry” armor set, its bonuses are generally subpar compared to a well-rolled Guardsman’s set. When choosing gear, aim for stats like Strength, Armor, and Toughness to improve both your damage and survivability.
    </p>
    <h3>Weapon &amp; Attributes</h3>
    <p>
      For your glaive, try to obtain the highest tier available. When reforging or rolling stats, prioritize <strong>+Blunt Damage</strong> as this significantly boosts the damage of <em>Flying Reaper</em>, which scales excellently with blunt damage. Additional valuable stats include Strength (to increase base damage), Slashing Damage, and Armor Penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you desire a more defensive stat spread, you might allocate a portion of points to Toughness (for extra HP) or Armor (for base damage reduction), but typically Strength gives the best bang for your buck. A sample all-rounder distribution might be 80% Strength and 20% Toughness—though many players opt for 100% Strength and rely on gear to provide defense.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Skills and Traits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>God of Battles – Team Buff:</strong> Increases damage dealt by you and nearby allies by 15% for 6–10 seconds. Uniquely, it also boosts the Glaive’s Armor Penetration and dispels the "Concussed" debuff from you upon use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Warlord’s Greeting – CC Strike:</strong> A two-hit overhead slash combo that deals solid damage and inflicts a stun/Concuss on the target. With a 12-second cooldown, it’s excellent for disabling enemy heroes and setting them up for follow-up attacks. Its Concuss effect is particularly potent as typical CC-cleanses do not remove it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flying Reaper – AoE Ultimate:</strong> The Glaive’s preferred Paragon (ultimate) skill—a devastating leaping polearm slam. You leap up and smash the ground, dealing massive blunt damage in a wide area. Enemies hit are thrown down (knocked down hard) and suffer a debuff taking 10% increased damage for several seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AoE Control:</strong> The Glaive’s broad swings and crowd-control effects are ideal for holding lines or clearing breaches. Even basic glaive attacks have a wide arc that can hit multiple foes at once.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Healing &amp; Sustain:</strong> Although the Glaive does not have a direct healing skill (unlike the Longsword’s heal), it boasts strong sustain through damage mitigation and the benefits of heavy armor.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Skill Rotation</h2>
    <p>
      An effective Glaive rotation revolves around buffing allies, controlling enemies, and unleashing AoE damage at the opportune moment. Here is a recommended sequence in a teamfight scenario:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pre-Buff with God of Battles:</strong> Just before engaging, activate <em>God of Battles</em> to boost your team’s damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Engage and Close the Gap:</strong> Use your mount and the Charge skill to engage—knock down frontline enemies and position yourself within the enemy group.</li>
      <li><strong>Initial Crowd Control – Warlord’s Greeting:</strong> Upon reaching your target, open with <em>Warlord’s Greeting</em> on a key enemy hero or cluster to deal damage and Concuss/stun the target, preventing dodges or counters.</li>
      <li><strong>Big AoE Knockdown – Flying Reaper:</strong> Immediately follow with <em>Flying Reaper</em> to slam the area while enemies are still staggered by your initial strike. This skill throws down all nearby foes and applies a debuff for increased damage taken.</li>
      <li><strong>Defensive Reset:</strong> If you get focused or an enemy attempts to crowd control you, use <em>Heat of Battle</em> to cleanse any stun and gain damage reduction—helping you remain in the fight.</li>
      <li><strong>Re-engage or Regroup:</strong> After your big skills, you can use the short cooldown of <em>Warlord’s Greeting</em> to pick off stragglers or protect an ally.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>TL;DR Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Role &amp; Style:</strong> The Glaive is a heavy polearm class that balances offense, defense, and support. It excels as a frontline support bruiser—buffing allies and controlling crowds while dealing respectable damage.
