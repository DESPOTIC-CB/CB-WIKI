  <h1>Pike Class Guide – All-Purpose "Hero Killer" Build</h1>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Playstyle Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Pike is a lightning-fast polearm class built to hunt enemy heroes. In Conqueror’s Blade, it is a fast-paced, aggressive “assassin” that excels at taking down enemy heroes in duels and small skirmishes. Wielding a long polearm (pike), this class boasts excellent mobility and burst damage by chaining together low-cooldown skills to overwhelm opponents. Pike players dart in and out of combat using combos of thrusts, sweeps, and acrobatic flips to disable foes and deliver lethal blows. While effective at disrupting enemy formations and isolating targets, the Pike is less effective against large clusters of units. In short, this build turns you into a hero killer – engaging quickly, hitting hard, and retreating before the enemy can react.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Playstyle Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relentless Mobility:</strong> Extremely maneuverable with skills that leap, dash, and somersault around the battlefield, allowing you to rapidly reposition, flank vulnerable targets, or escape danger after a kill.</li>
      <li><strong>Chainable CC Combos:</strong> Nearly every Pike attack applies crowd control (knockdowns, knockbacks, or daze). Short cooldowns allow you to chain abilities with almost no downtime.</li>
      <li><strong>High Burst Damage:</strong> Explosive burst damage is delivered via multi-stage skill combos and a unique stacking buff. Normal attacks build “Strong as a Storm” stacks (up to +12% damage), empowering your skill combos.</li>
      <li><strong>Glass Cannon Tendencies:</strong> Although medium armor grants some protection, you are less durable than heavy classes. The build leverages toughness for survivability—but you must avoid sustained fights, as a well-timed hard CC can quickly “delete” you.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Skills and Traits</h2>
    <p>
      The Pike’s kit revolves around five “Dragon” skills (three core skills and two ultimates) that can be chained in sequence to create custom combos. The key skills include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sky Dragon:</strong> A multi-stage polearm combo delivering mixed damage (piercing thrusts and blunt strikes) along with heavy crowd control.</li>
      <li><strong>Wandering Dragon:</strong> An evasive retreat and buff skill that can provide a damage/penetration boost.</li>
      <li><strong>Water Dragon:</strong> A forward lunge and multi-hit thrust that quickly closes the gap and knocks the target down.</li>
      <li><strong>Green Dragon (Ultimate):</strong> The preferred ultimate—a charge attack that cannot be blocked, with its distance and effect based on charge time.</li>
      <li><strong>Strong as a Storm (Passive):</strong> Every normal left-click attack adds a stack that increases your damage by approximately 4% per stack (up to 3 stacks for around +12% total damage).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Superb Mobility:</strong> Multiple dodges, backflips, and charges allow you to engage or disengage at will. Few enemies can catch a Pike who doesn’t want to be caught.</li>
      <li><strong>Lethal 1v1 Duelist:</strong> In single combat, the Pike’s continuous CC and burst potential make it a fearsome opponent.</li>
      <li><strong>High Burst &amp; Combo Potential:</strong> Chaining your ultimate with follow-up strikes can result in explosive damage; a well-executed combo can melt squishy heroes or severely wound tougher ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Excellent Crowd Control:</strong> Nearly every skill provides some form of CC—knockbacks, knockdowns, or status cleanses—making the Pike not only deadly but also a disruptor in team fights.</li>
      <li><strong>Hit-and-Run Durability:</strong> With a medium armor build focusing on toughness, you have enough survivability to escape after an engage, even if you cannot facetank sustained damage.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fragile if Caught:</strong> Medium armor provides decent but limited protection. Hard CC chains or focused fire can take you out quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Unit Clearing:</strong> Your attacks are best suited for single targets or small areas, not large groups. You lack the sustained AoE of classes like Glaive or Maul.</li>
      <li><strong>Combo-Dependent:</strong> Success relies on executing precise skill combos. Missing key openings or having an opponent dodge your ultimate can let a kill opportunity slip away.</li>
      <li><strong>High Skill Cap:</strong> While easy to pick up, mastering Pike requires situational awareness, precise timing, and knowing when to disengage.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Skill Rotation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Burst Combo (Hero Delete Rotation):</strong> Use this rotation when you spot a prime target (such as a squishy ranged hero or a warrior who just used their escape).</li>
      <li><strong>Approach &amp; Buff:</strong> Begin with a couple of basic attacks to build “Strong as a Storm” stacks (up to +12% damage). Optionally, use Wandering Dragon [II] just before engaging to gain a 12% damage and penetration boost for 4 seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Gap-Close with Water Dragon:</strong> Activate Water Dragon III to lunge at the target and knock them down. This three-step thrust combo quickly closes the distance and leaves the enemy floored.</li>
      <li><strong>Ultimate Strike:</strong> Immediately follow up with Green Dragon (Ultimate). Aim at the fallen or staggered target. If possible, charge briefly (or fully if the target is still CC’d) for massive piercing damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate Finisher:</strong> Right after Green Dragon, quickly trigger Sky Dragon or Water Dragon again to deliver a final-stage attack that capitalizes on the combo.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate &amp; Exit:</strong> If the enemy hero is still clinging to life, finish them off with a few quick basic attacks or a follow-up Sky Dragon I/II. Then disengage using Wandering Dragon III (backflip) or a dodge roll.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Recommended Gear, and Attribute Distribution</h2>
    <h3>Gear (Weapon &amp; Armor)</h3>
    <p>
      As a medium armor class, you can equip light or medium armor pieces—but not heavy armor. For an all-purpose build, stick with full medium armor to maximize defense without sacrificing agility. A popular choice is the Carnifex set—a craftable rare/epic set known for its excellent balance. Look for purple (epic) or gold quality pieces with high rolls in Health, Armor, and Strength/Toughness. For your weapon, use the highest-tier Pike available, prioritizing bonus stats in Piercing Damage and Piercing Armor Penetration. Secondary desirable stats include Strength (to boost base damage) or Skill Damage.
    </p>
    <h3>Attribute Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      A recommended distribution is to invest heavily in Toughness for survivability. Many players suggest a mix such as 80% Toughness and 20% Agility—for example, if you have 100 attribute points, allocate about 80 to Toughness and 20 to Agility. This grants you enough bulk to handle enemy burst while still benefiting from agility’s damage bonus. If you feel confident in your dodging ability and want more burst, you might try a more balanced (50/50) split, though this will make you more fragile.
    </p>

    <h2>Pro Tips for Pike Players</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick Your Battles:</strong> Look for isolated or distracted enemy heroes. A Pike excels when catching someone off-guard or in a 1v1 situation.</li>
      <li><strong>Patience &amp; Timing:</strong> Wait until an enemy uses their escape or key skill—then strike hard when they’re vulnerable. Many kills are secured right after the enemy dodges their own abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Combo Creativity:</strong> Practice chaining your skills in training. Learn to cancel or chain skills smoothly (for example, after using Green Dragon, immediately chain into Water Dragon’s final strikes to extend the CC and damage).</li>
      <li><strong>Capitalize on Downed Enemies:</strong> When you knock an enemy down, they are defenseless for a moment. Use that cue to unleash heavy damage with Sky Dragon’s heavy slam or follow up with basic attacks.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>TL;DR (Summary)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fast Hero Assassin:</strong> The Pike is a high-mobility, high-burst class built for quickly killing enemy heroes. It excels at flanking and dueling but is less effective against groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Core Playstyle:</strong> Play like a skirmisher—dart in, disable and burst down a target, then disengage. Chain low-cooldown skills for continuous crowd control and damage, and use superior agility to avoid extended fights.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Use Water Dragon to engage (gap-close and knockdown), Sky Dragon to finish combos (AOE slam and CC), and Wandering Dragon for buffs and mobility. The Green Dragon ultimate is your go-to for massive burst damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Combos:</strong> A common burst rotation is: Buff with Wandering Dragon [II] → Water Dragon [III] knockdown → Green Dragon ult → instant Sky Dragon [III] slam.</li>
      <li><strong>Gear & Build:</strong> Wear full medium armor (e.g., Carnifex set) for a balance of defense and mobility, and use a high-level Pike with strong piercing damage/penetration stats. Allocate attributes heavily into Toughness (with some Agility as desired).</li>
    </ul>
